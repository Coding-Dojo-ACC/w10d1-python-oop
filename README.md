4 pillars:
* Encapsulation
  * Restrict access to methods and attributes preventing accidental modification of data.
* Abstraction
  * An extension of Encapsulation - it is added to our classes so they only expose what it needs to the public
* Polymorphism
  * Something appears in different forms. 
* Inheritance
  * Classes interacting with each other and some being subclasses of another taking on some similar attributes
